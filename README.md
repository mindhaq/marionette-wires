Marionette Wires - Revisited
============================

An opinionated example application built with Marionette.js. 

## Overview

This is a fork of [Marionette Wires](https://github.com/thejameskyle/marionette-wires), with the following differences:

* Use [Marionette](http://marionettejs.com/) v3 instead of v2
* Use [marionette.routing](https://github.com/blikblum/marionette.routing) instead of [backbone.routing](https://github.com/thejameskyle/backbone-routing)
* Use [webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) instead of browserify and gulp
* No server, just client side

#### New features

* Code splitting of colors routes (open network tab of dev tools and go to colors section)
* Remember last selected book
* Colors pagination is implemented without destructive render
 
 Check the [live version](https://blikblum.github.io/marionette-wires-revisited/dist/)
